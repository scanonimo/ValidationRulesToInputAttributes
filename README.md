## Convert validation rules to input attributes

Given the following validation rule:

```
'username' => ['required', 'string', 'min:3', 'max:64',
                'regex:/^[a-z]([a-z0-9]|[a-z0-9]\.[a-z0-9])*$/i']
```

It can be converted to the following input with its attributes:

```
<input 
    name="username" 
    required="required" 
    type="text" 
    minlength="3" 
    maxlength="64" 
    pattern="^[a-z]([a-z0-9]|[a-z0-9]\.[a-z0-9])*$" 
>
```

Visiting route ‘/signup’ get, it is possible to see the result of applying this concept.

Please visit the following link if you will like to give me feedback. I’m a newbie laravel and OOp programer, and any comment on how I could improved will be very much appreciated.

If my code is a little hard to read, please check my tests and commit sequence, where I try to justify the purpose of every line in my code. Especially BlueprintsFactoryTest.
